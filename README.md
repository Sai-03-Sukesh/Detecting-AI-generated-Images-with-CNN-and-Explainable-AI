# Detecting-AI-generated-Images-with-CNN-and-Explainable-AI
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to distinguish between real and AI-generated images using the DenseNet121 architecture. By leveraging a dataset of 140,000 images from Kaggle, the model achieves a high accuracy of 93.4% in classification tasks.
